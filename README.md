# Tornado Cash Relayers Staking Protocol

Relayers Dao is the Tornado Cash relayers staking protocol,which allows their users to earn relayers staking rewards without locking TORN or maintaining relayers infrastructure.

Relayers Dao will definitely motivate more people to know theTornado Cash and become the relayers.

The Relayers Dao can reduce the torn circulation and pump up the price of TORN.

Currently,the amount of TORN locked in the Tornado Cash governance contract is 761,984 TORN when Tornado Cash staking average APR is 20-70%.The amount of TORN locked in the Relayers Dao will be 2-3 times because the relayers staking average APR is 100-200%,you can image the TORN price.
